# Kata-OldLadyWhoSwallowedAFly
This Kata is based on the presentation "RailsConf 2016 - Succession" by Katrina Owen (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59YClXmkCVM).

The code for her presentation was implemented in Ruby. This is a C# version of the same code. I created Helpers (extension methods)
to keep the code flow and readability as close as possible.
